# this is intended to be run from a lubuntu livecd (with sda partitions unmounted)
# and requires a drive attached with a mounted partition with volume label DATA 
# to store the snapshot of the whole device to a gzipped file which can be uncompressed 
# on a target laptop
# to get started from a livecd with all the tools you could get wifi connected and install like
# sudo apt-get install pigz pv git 
=======

# it might be required to modify fstab to point 
# to device names (instead of ids) and change grub to disable uuids 
# then run update-grub before imaging the source laptop so that disk uuid changes
# don't prevent boot
